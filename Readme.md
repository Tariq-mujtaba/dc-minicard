## Overview

![Minimal Blog Card Screenshot](https://github.com/Tariq-mujtaba/minimal-blogcard/raw/main/resources/screenshot/Screenshot.png)

This project is a minimalistic blog card component that showcases a simple design with a clean and modern aesthetic. The card includes a featured image, a tag, a blog title, a brief description, and the author's name. It is built using HTML and CSS to demonstrate a minimal approach to web design, focusing on typography, layout, and visual appeal.

## What I learned

- **Responsive Layouts**: By creating a flexible card layout, I learned how to make a design that adjusts well to different screen sizes while keeping the content centered and readable.
- **CSS Variables**: I explored the use of CSS custom properties (variables) to make the styling more manageable and reusable throughout the stylesheet.
- **Typography Design**: I learned how to style and scale text to create a hierarchy in content, making it easy to distinguish between headings, body text, and other elements.
- **Flexbox**: I used Flexbox to easily align and justify content within containers, ensuring that elements are well-placed without needing complex positioning or floats.
- **Minimalism in Web Design**: This project helped me understand how to embrace simplicity while still making the design visually appealing through good color choices, spacing, and structure.
